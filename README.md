# sf-bot

SFBot - a Discord.py bot.

This bot's data collection is powered by pytesseract and pyautogui.

The purpose of this bot is to collect information from a War Intel Pad in 'Star Wars Galaxies' reguarding other players that are flagged for special forces (Locates players that are able to be attacked by other players). It automates the process by alerting when players have entered the popular PvP (Player vs. Player) area known as Restuss, and allowing players to pull all GCW information even when they are not actively playing the game.

Dependancies:
- python 3.9
- discord.py
- pyautogui
- pytesseract
- pillow
- asyncio

** Note: Game UI pallete must be set to 'Destroyer'
